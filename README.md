# WhatBabeAreYouQuiz

Credit to sophie006liu for creation of the source code. We modified her "What Vegetable Are You?" Quiz (which is super fun, by the way!) to work for our own game! github link to original game source code: https://github.com/sophie006liu/vegetal

A copy of her Apache license is attached, and I have followed the requirements for modifying and using her script.

NOTICE: QuizContent.js is an edited version of sophie006liu's vegetal mainGame.js file with the story logic path being entirely rewritten. Changes were also made to file structure and contents, and my own photos were uploaded. Descriptions were added for result images. Output structure was changed and used to include our own additional content, including modifications to print more text. Logic was changed to parse through additional information and output correct results.
